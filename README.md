# Findbrokeninternallinks

Findbrokeninternallinks is a Python script that searches one or more HTML files
for internal links that are invalid, reporting them to standard output.

I wrote this to verify that the documentation produced by
[mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org) did not have any dangling references. I could
not find a non-web-based application that did what I
want. [Linkchecker](https://linkchecker.github.io/linkchecker/) has problems
checking internal links. [The W3C Link
Checker](https://validator.w3.org/checklink) has problems when running on local
files.

## Dependencies
